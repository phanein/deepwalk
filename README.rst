DeepWalk
===============================

DeepWalk uses short random walks to learn representations for vertices in graphs.

Usage
-----

**Example Usage**
    ``$deepwalk --input example_graphs/karate.adjlist --output karate.embeddings``

**--input**:  *input_filename*

    1. ``--format adjlist`` for an adjacency list, e.g::

        1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 11 12 13 14 18 20 22 32
        2 1 3 4 8 14 18 20 22 31
        3 1 2 4 8 9 10 14 28 29 33
        ...
    
    2. ``--format edgelist`` for an edge list, e.g::
    
        1 2
        1 3
        1 4
        ...
    
    3. ``--format mat`` for a Matlab .mat file containing an adjacency matrix
        (note, you must also specify the variable name of the adjacency matrix ``--matfile-variable-name``)

**--output**: *output_filename*

    The output representations in skipgram format - first line is header, all other lines are node-id and *d* dimensional representation::

        34 64
        1 0.016579 -0.033659 0.342167 -0.046998 ...
        2 -0.007003 0.265891 -0.351422 0.043923 ...
        ...

**Full Command List**
    The full list of command line options is available with ``$deepwalk --help``

Evaluation
----------
Here, we will show how to evaluate DeepWalk on the *BlogCatalog* dataset used in the DeepWalk paper.
First, we run the following command to produce its DeepWalk embeddings::

    deepwalk --format mat --input example_graphs/blogcatalog.mat
    --max-memory-data-size 0 --number-walks 80 --representation-size 128 --walk-length 40 --window-size 10
    --workers 1 --output example_graphs/blogcatalog.embeddings

The parameters specified here are the same as in the paper.
If you are using a multi-core machine, try to set ``--workers`` to a larger number for faster training.
On a single machine with 24 Xeon E5-2620 @ 2.00GHz CPUs, this command takes about 20 minutes to finish (``--workers`` is set to 20).
Then, we evaluate the learned embeddings on a multi-label node classification task with ``example_graphs/scoring.py``::

    python example_graphs/scoring.py --emb example_graphs/blogcatalog.embeddings
    --network example_graphs/blogcatalog.mat
    --num-shuffle 10 --all

This command finishes in 8 minutes on the same machine. For faster evaluation, you can set ``--num-shuffle`` to a smaller number, but expect more fluctuation in performance. The micro F1 and macro F1 scores we get with different ratio of labeled nodes are as follows:

+-----------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
| % Labeled Nodes | 10%   | 20%   | 30%   | 40%   | 50%   | 60%   | 70%   | 80%   | 90%   |
+=================+=======+=======+=======+=======+=======+=======+=======+=======+=======+
| *Micro-F1 (%)*  | 35.86 | 38.51 | 39.96 | 40.76 | 41.51 | 41.85 | 42.27 | 42.35 | 42.40 |
+-----------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
| *Macro-F1 (%)*  | 21.08 | 23.98 | 25.71 | 26.73 | 27.68 | 28.28 | 28.88 | 28.70 | 28.21 |
+-----------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+

**Note that the current version of DeepWalk is based on a newer version of gensim, which may have a different implementation of the word2vec model. To completely reproduce the results in our paper, you will probably have to install an older version of gensim(version 0.10.2).**
